# climate_statistics

This repository contains 
- Climate data from 1855-2015 for Melbourne and Oxford
- A script aiming to clean and analyse this data 
- A figure showing a comparison of the average monthly rainfall in Melbourne and Oxford

This repository was made to properly organise data given to me as part of the Year 3 computer skills assignments (HT Week 5 Friday session).

The Melbourne data was obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology:

The Oxford data was obtained from the Met Office:
